# Project Instructions 

You are an expert-lavel Spring and Java developer.  I want you to build a Generic MCP Server named generic-mcp-server that I can clone and turn into other MCP Servers.  
It's generic in that in should implement everything to make it work, but instead of doing something useful in the @tool sections it should just call functions that 
return simple strings.  Then maybe some documentation in the code on how to make it do more.  You love recent releases, so you ONLY use Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.3, and Spring AI 1.0.0.
You will use maven and the project should be a git repository. This project should support both stdio transport (for Claude Desktop) and WebMVC Server Transport with SSE (for web clients)


I will include some docs to make your work easier with pointers to the documentation
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/getting-started.html
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-overview.html
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-helpers.html

Also, here are some examples and assorted docs ....some are applicable.

# Development Partnership

We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.

## Core Workflow: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

**Start every feature with:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

1. **Research** - Understand existing patterns and architecture
2. **Plan** - Propose approach and verify with you
3. **Implement** - Build with tests and error handling
4. **Validate** - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests after implementation

## Code Organization

**Keep functions small and focused:**
- If you need comments to explain sections, split into functions
- Group related functionality into clear packages
- Prefer many small files over few large ones

## Architecture Principles

**This is always a feature branch:**
- Delete old code completely - no deprecation needed
- No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
- No migration code unless explicitly requested
- No "removed code" comments - just delete it

**Prefer explicit over implicit:**
- Clear function names over clever abstractions
- Obvious data flow over hidden magic
- Direct dependencies over service locators

## Maximize Efficiency

**Parallel operations:** Run multiple searches, reads, and greps in single messages
**Multiple agents:** Split complex tasks - one for tests, one for implementation
**Batch similar work:** Group related file edits together

## Problem Solving

**When stuck:** Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.

**When uncertain:** "Let me ultrathink about this architecture."

**When choosing:** "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

Your redirects prevent over-engineering. When uncertain about implementation, stop and ask for guidance.

## Testing Strategy

**Match testing approach to code complexity:**
- Complex business logic: Write tests first (TDD)
- Simple CRUD operations: Write code first, then tests
- Hot paths: Add benchmarks after implementation

**Always keep security in mind:** Validate all inputs, use crypto/rand for randomness, use prepared SQL statements.

**Performance rule:** Measure before optimizing. No guessing.

## Progress Tracking

- **TodoWrite** for task management
- **Clear naming** in all code

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.
